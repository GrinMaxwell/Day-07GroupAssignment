- Travis' notes

I did this header pretty quickly. I'm proud of it. I learned about background image positioning, which is pretty cool.
I actually got it done the afternoon it was assigned. But i've been having trouble turning it in because I seem to be estranged from the group. I have a branch, but can't push or pull or merge or anything.

It's really quite sad. I'm confused as to what the problem is, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the way my git folder situation was set up when i originally cloned the branch. At the time, I had .git on my entire TIY folder, and was just updating the whole thing. So the problem probably has something to do with trying to put repos inside other repos.

I get it now, and `git init` inside each project individually. I am not how exactly how to fix this at all.
So, i'll need help figuring that out so I can get credit for this. Since, i'm pretty sure that if I hadn't had git on my TIY directory, there would never have been any issue, and this would have been turned in back in the day.
